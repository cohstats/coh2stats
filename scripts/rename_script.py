# README
# This script removes duplicate words (seperated by underscore "_" ) from the filenames of sourceDir.
# It also removes the leftover underscores.
# The original files are kept intact in sourceDir.
# The copied + renamed files are available in targetDir.

# example:  original    - 6_8_brody_6_8_brody_x300.webp
#           result      - 6_8_brody_x300.webp

# modify the following directory names to your needs.
